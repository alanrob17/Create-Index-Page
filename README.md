# IndexPage notes

``IndexPage`` is a Console program that collects all formatted HTML pages in a folder and collates them into a Contents page.

The Content page collects all H1, H2 and H3 links and allows me to quickly navigate to a section in my documentation.

## Process

Create a project to run through a notes folder (non-recursive) and grab all formatted HTML files. These are files that have a format of ``*-f.html``. These are templated pages that have been created for viewing.

I need to build an Index page that lists all these pages and their contents. This will allow me to navigate to a particular section in my documents.
